## Instruction :
### Admin Login
The admin dashboard is only accessible with correct admin email id i.e. `admin@gmail.com`. 
### Employee Login

Employees can login with their email id which is entered by the admin while adding the new employee.
The database has no employees initially. Add employee in the admin dashboard to allow that employee to login in the employee dashboard.
