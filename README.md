## Instructions :
### Admin Login
The admin dashboard is only accessible with correct admin email id i.e. `admin@gmail.com`. 
### Employee Login 
The employee dashboard is only accessible by the employees added by the admin.
Employees can login with their email id which is entered by the admin while adding the new employee.
The database has no employees initially. Add employee in the admin dashboard to allow that employee to login in the employee dashboard.
### Aditional Instructions :
If you click the browser's refresh button in the employee dashboard then you will have to login again as it is protected by a guard which will reset the flags on refresh. If you still need to do it (maybe if data didn't refresh) then toggle b/w the "My Profile" and "Leave" buttons on the left of the screen once.
